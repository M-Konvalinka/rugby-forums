# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Rugby Forums

This is a personal project that would replicate online forums. This forum would be rugby specific and would originally cater to 4 different leagues at the start which are the MLR, Pro 14, Premiership & Super Rugby leagues. After the project has reached MVP status, I will deploy the project live using Heroku.
